Bubble sort is an inversion bound algorithm. To prove this,
letâ€™s assume for an array A of size n, there are two indexes
k, j where k < j but A[k] > A[j]. If we can show that there
will be a comparison between the these elements, we prove that
our algorithm is inversion bound. Inside the nested for loop
every element is compared with their neighbors and get swapped
if found in reverse order. This leads to checking A[k] with most
elements (most definitely A[j], but not elements at the right
end of the array having values greater than A[k]) and swapped to
the right. This shows that our bubble sort is an inversion bound
algorithm.
