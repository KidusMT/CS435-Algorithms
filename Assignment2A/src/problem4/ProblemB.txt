Algorithm removeDups(L)
    Input: a list L
    Output: a hashMap M containing distinct of L with key value pair
    M <- new hashMap
    for i <- 0 to L.size()-1 do
        if not M.get(L(i)) null then
           M.put(L(i))
        return M


Reason: Since hashmap has big-oh O(1) it will improve the previous
implementation which was done using "contains" which is nested for
loop indirectly. Therefore, our big-oh will drop to O(n) which comes
from the for loop iteration.
