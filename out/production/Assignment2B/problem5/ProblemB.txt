The best case is: Omega(n^2)

The worst case is: O(n^2)

This shows us that both the worst case and best
case for our bubble sort is O(n^2) because even
if the items are sorted the swap only happens
for an items which are not in order. Therefore,
we can only save the time complexity for the
swap instead of the nested for loop. Which has
to iterate for both ordered and reverse ordered
array list.
